    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p><em>Miss Barton's Famous Cakes</em> is a short film set under the film noir theme that was published in 2019. The directors are Jared Hirsch, and Nelson Vicens, and cinematographed by Gino Varisano. The film has various cinematic elements that come together to create meaning. Through thoughtful decisions in narrative, mise-en-scène, cinematography,  genre, editing, sound, acting performance, color style, Transtextuality, and technical execution, the filmmakers draw viewers into a world where the ordinary act of baking cakes intertwines with crime, mystery, and human interaction. In this analysis, I will examine how the film’s formal elements work in harmony, how the filmmaker’s choices shape meaning, and the impact of genre on the viewer’s interpretation. 
    </p>

     <h2>Opening Scene and Transtextuality</h2>
     <p>
	The opening scene has some type of transtextuality, which is paratextuality as the title alone suggests the story might be food-based or community-centered, like a family tale, a moral fable, or a slice-of-life character. It cues the viewer into a specific genre or emotional tone, a cozy, character-driven tale, even before the scene starts.
        The short film starts with a visual juxtaposition scene that has a sequence of shots of a simple, comforting act of baking with underlying tension because of the sound background. It was shot with a dissolve transition (when the shot of sifting flour and dissolve transition happened to blend with the shot of pouring milk). The shot where the camera transitions to the cinnamon can foreshadows the moment when she later reveals the secret ingredient in the cake recipe. When Barton tries to catch the can and it falls, the transition to the rat can serves as another foreshadowing—this time of the scene where she is seen looking at the rat can while preparing cakes for the two detectives.
    </p>
    
   
        
     <h2>Cinematography</h2>

	<p>
        Cinematography plays a key role in highlighting this contrast. The film uses close-up shots to make the viewer focus on the facial expressions and raise the tension. For example, we see Miss Barton's delicate, careful movements while frosting cakes, and her facial expressions closely when tension rises. These close-ups show subtle feelings of pride, nervousness, fear, and defiance that reveal what's not being said aloud. This adds psychological depth to a character who might otherwise seem calm or routine-driven. Paired with wide-angle shots of her isolated bakery, to create a sense of calm before the storm. In addition, there is a close shot of the newspaper pieces on the table when the detective looks at them. To reveal the details of Barton’s character to the viewers like the conflict between her and the people through the article “Recent Demand Too Much For One Woman Bakery”.

    <p>
        This visual tension mirrors the character's inner conflict, as she juggles her role as a friendly baker with a deeper, more mysterious involvement in a local crime syndicate. The filmmaker’s decision to linger on these contrasts builds suspense and keeps the viewer on edge, creating an atmosphere that suggests something darker beneath the surface.
    </p>

<h2>Sound and Lighting</h2>
    <p>
        The sound design in the film is clever. From the first second, it gives the viewer the idea that something mysterious will happen. The soundscape of the knocking on the door matches the cinematography, which maintains continuity.
    </p>
    <p>
        As we know, there are two types of sound: diegetic and non-diegetic. The diegetic sound was the sound of the heavy rainfall and the thunder that makes the viewer understand the weather is bad, and the choice of this sound by the filmmaker is to give the viewer the idea that no one in this weather is risking going outside, and also it is a perfect night for a crime to happen.
    </p>
    <p>
        The non-diegetic sound was the background music that played throughout the film, changing according to the scene to put us in a certain mood or frame of mind. This choice played a strong element in leveling up the film to a higher level. It was engaging and linked us to the untold lines and emotions.
    </p>
    <p>
        In the film, the light was very important to maintain as the film is in black and white. Most of the light was from an artificial light source (you may argue that the thunder is natural light, but the way they directed the scene, it is hard to maintain good real thunder light inside the house). In the scene from 8:56 – 9:01, we can see how the light was hitting hard on their faces (Fill light type). When it hit Barton’s face, her face was half-lightened and the other was dark (showing the conflicts between the good side and the bad side conflicting inside her, should I kill them with the knife or the poison rat is enough, ~I will discuss this later~ or I am just a baker that everyone loves my cakes).
    </p>

            <source src="video1.mp4" type="video/mp4" />
        </video>
    </div>


    <p>
        For example, in the shot from 3:13 – 3:17, it starts by moving the camera from a medium shot to a close-up shot of the detective's face, at the same time the thunder sound hits after the word “butcher boys” and the lighting of the thunder lights the face of the detective and the room. Here they used an artificial light to create the thunder which lightened the room. All this made the scene scarier and took the attention of the viewer to make us wonder if something dangerous happened or may happen. All these elements from sound to lighting to acting skills came together to create meaning for the scene.
    </p>
    <p>
        These choices create a sensory experience where the viewer’s comfort with the everyday is consistently challenged by moments of unease, pushing them to question Miss Barton’s true motives.

The ticking clock functions as a symbol of time, urgency, and inevitability. Its steady, unrelenting sound underscores a moment of internal pressure for the character perhaps she's waiting for something, dreading what's to come, or feeling the weight of time running out. The ticking may also foreshadow a pivotal event, creating suspense and aligning the film with crime/thriller genre conventions, where time is often a critical force with looming consequences. In this context, the clock becomes a metaphor for the character’s emotional state: she is trapped in a moment where every second matters and the sound externalizes her mounting anxiety.
</p>
<p>
The reflection of the character’s face in the window is a visual metaphor. Windows often symbolize barriers between inside and outside, between the self and the world, or between truth and illusion. Seeing her reflection in this moment suggests introspection or duality: she is literally facing herself, but also metaphorically confronting the duplicity of her life (especially if her cakes become a crime element that made two psychos).
The reflection blurs the line between her internal and external worlds, mirroring the film’s larger theme of hidden truths behind everyday appearances. It's also an effective use of mise-en-scène, using the setting and framing to deepen character development.
</p>

<p>
The combination of these elements minimal dialogue, the ticking clock, and the quiet framing of her reflection contributes to a somber, reflective mood. It invites the viewer to pause with the character, to feel her hesitation or inner turmoil. This shift in tone from the possibly more lively or vibrant scenes earlier in the film reinforces how the film weaves between genre modes: from cozy domesticity of baking to noir-inflected psychological drama.
By isolating this moment with sound and reflection, the filmmaker prompts the viewer to interpret rather than simply observe. The audience is encouraged to ask: What is she thinking? What is she hiding? What decision does she face? In this way, the scene acts as a multimodal text, where sound, image, and gesture work together to generate meaning, rather than relying solely on dialogue or narration.

<h2>Genre and Multimodal Crime</h2>
    <p>
        At its heart, <em>Miss Barton's Famous Cakes</em> is a crime thriller, but it weaves in elements of dark comedy and noir to deepen its complexity. This blending of genres becomes a way to explore the theme of duality the contrast between how someone appears in public versus who they are in private. Miss Barton’s cakes symbolize this tension: on the outside, they represent charm, success, and warmth, but as the story unfolds, they take on a more unsettling role, even becoming the obsession of two serial killers who might harm her. The genre mix allows the tone to shift between light and dark from cheerful baking scenes to moments of real danger and suspense, keeping the audience off-balance and unsure of what’s coming next. This unpredictability mirrors Miss Barton herself, adding to the mystery surrounding her character. Genre conventions, especially those rooted in crime thrillers and noir, also guide how viewers understand character dynamics. Her interactions with the police, marked by snappy dialogue and subtle tension, echo noir’s focus on moral gray areas and mistrust. These genre choices make the audience question: Is Miss Barton an innocent woman trapped in a twisted situation, or is she orchestrating it all from behind the scenes?
    </p>
    <p>
        As I mentioned before, the opening scene was a foreshadowing about the cans. At 7:30, that deadly piercing look at the rat poison can is shot by a low-angle shot pointing at her face to give us the feeling that she is now in control of the situation she is facing and she found the solution to get rid of the detectives. Then, by parallel editing, it went to the shot of the rat can from a high-angle shot, and then back to her, and boom the thunder hit with that strong sound, and its light lit the background behind her. All those decisions to film this shot like this were just to give the viewer the impression that the evil idea has flashed through her head and will save herself.
    </p>
<div class="video-container">
        <video width="640" height="360" controls="controls">
            <source src="video3.mp4" type="video/mp4" />
        </video>
    </div>
    <p>
        On the other hand, the film doesn’t explicitly show whether she actually used the rat poison or not. The scene at 7:30 seems to imply that she did, but it’s left to the viewer’s interpretation. However, I feel that the decision to have her hold a large, sharp knife while serving the cakes is either a hidden message or a deliberate attempt to mislead the audience. Why is she carrying a knife if she already used poison in the cake? Isn’t the poison enough to do the job? Or did she not use the poison at all and brought the knife as a means of self-defense against the detectives? Another clue appears between 10:56 and 11:02, when the detective starts coughing and the background music shifts to a mysterious tone before settling into a simple bell-like note. I was shocked—he’s not going to die?! Did she actually use the rat poison or not? What really happened? All of these are subtle hints—or perhaps intentional misdirections—designed to make the viewer question the truth.
    </p>
<div class="video-container">
        <video width="640" height="360" controls="controls">
            <source src="video4.mp4" type="video/mp4" />
        </video>
    </div>


    <p>
        The crime elements were all shown mysteriously depending on the viewer's understanding. Only when the detective mentions the two butchers’ sons who killed the woman who served them the cake in the mental hospital and their bloody history were the crimes spoken clearly by dialog. So the crimes are all hidden, and by the sound, acting skills, and dialog its message or action is delivered to the viewer.
    </p>



<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>
        The film operates as a multimodal text, engaging viewers through visual, auditory, and narrative modes to deliver its themes. The visual storytelling techniques close-ups, lighting choices, and mise-en-scène tell much of the story without dialogue, while the sound design enhances the emotional and thematic undercurrents of the narrative. The film’s genre of crime thriller mixed with dark comedy adds yet another layer of meaning, influencing how the audience approaches the film’s characters and themes. Each of these elements, when considered together, reinforces the film’s central message about the complexities of identity and the blurred lines between good and evil.
